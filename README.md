Feedback (Idea)

-> It will AUTO refresh the browser.
-> Makes development easy.

- Comments
-> These are part of the code which the computer will not execute but they are helpful for human understanding.

- placeholder
-> Used as a helper text to tell which input we are expecting.

- CSS Selector?
-> Like a set of rules. Any element which matches this rule, will get the style applied. (Selects the element, based on some certain conditions).

Tag Type Selector -> Select based on the tag.
Class Selector -> Select by the class.
